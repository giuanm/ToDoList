A new ToDo list format for everyday use. The information is saved in the localStorage of the devices on which it is being accessed, making it possible to have/use an agenda or reminder of something. Even when the page is updated, the information remains available until it is edited or deleted from the List. To build this application, only JavaScript, CSS and HTML were used.

In this application I was able to put into practice various JavaScript knowledge, such as: Functions, Conditionals, Variable Types, Arrays, DOM Manipulation, Forms, Events in JS and other items.
